It is really easy, by now, there is no installer but i am working in it.

In order to install Darya in your machine you just need to follow these steps.

1. Download the files that are in this repo, this is really easy with $ git clone https://github.com/Garyi/Darya-Terminal-Assistant.git. A forlder will be generated 
2. Rename the generated folder to dlib
3. Move that folder to /usr/local/bin. try $ sudo mv dlib /usr/local/bin/dlib
4. Inside dlib is a file with the name "darya", that file move it to /usr/local/bin. try $ sudo mv darya /usr/local/bin/darya
5. type in terminal sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/darya, this will make darya execuable

Now darya should work, test it typing darya in your terminal
